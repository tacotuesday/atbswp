# Code Snippets from "Automate The Boring Stuff with Python"
This is a repository of code from Al Sweigart's book, "Automate The Boring Stuff with Python", in order to keep progress with the book no matter what computer I am using at the moment. My hope is that it becomes a personal library of useful code snippets.
